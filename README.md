# fastax
## Overview
fastax is a Deep Learning Library on top of Google's [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax/tree/master/jax) that tries to
facilitate doing research with it by providing many a combination of JAX's versatility with implementations of
the most used neural networks layers and utilities.


## Instalation
Simply type:
```
$ pip install fastax
```

## Quickstart

## Examples


## More concrete information and naming
fastax is both a combination of fastai and JAX and fastai and stax:
* It is built on top of JAX and most of its original code comes from a Neural Network mini-library called stax
* One of the long term goals of this library is implementing what Jeremy Howard teaches in his
 fastai course ["Deep Learning From the Foundations"](https://course.fast.ai/part2)
